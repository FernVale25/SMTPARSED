README for Fernando's SMT Solver stuff

1. Steps to the current solver that have to be kept in mind
   to understand or explain the process

   a. When a formula is translated to propositions, boolean variable
      k stands for "p \sigma 0 is required".  Thus, ~k does not
      mean "p \sigma 0 is false", rather it means "p \sigma 0
      is not required to be true".
